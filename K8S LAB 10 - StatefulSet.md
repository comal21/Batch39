Lab 10 - StatefulSet Implementation
=============================================================

# Task1 - Create Stateful Set
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Download file with yaml defintion for an nginx Stateful Set 
```
wget https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/files.cloudthat.training/devops/kubernetes-essentials/nginx-sts.yaml
```
Open a duplicate tab and run the below command
## Watch the pods getting created in an ordinal index fashion
```
kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx-sts
```
## Create a Stateful Set and  headless service by applying the yaml
```
kubectl apply -f nginx-sts.yaml
```

## Validate the headless service creation
```
kubectl get service nginx-svc
```

## Validate the stateful set creation
```
kubectl get statefulset nginx-sts
```


## Go to each of the pods to see the hostname, as a DNS entry is created for each Pod, the hostname inside the Pod should match the pod-name
```
for i in 0 1; do kubectl exec "nginx-sts-$i" -- sh -c 'hostname'; done
```

## Create a busybox pod to test the ping to one of the Ngninx pods by using DNS name of the pod
```
kubectl run -i --tty --image busybox:1.28 dns-test --restart=Never --rm
```
```
 nslookup nginx-sts-0.nginx-svc
```
```
nslookup nginx-sts-1.nginx-svc
```
```
exit
```
## In another window notice the new pods getting created in a proper order
```
kubectl get pod -w -l app=nginx-sts
```

## Delete the pods for stateful set
```
kubectl delete pod -l app=nginx-sts
```

## Verify the hostname in each of the newly created pods, it will match the pod name
```
for i in 0 1; do kubectl exec "nginx-sts-$i" -- sh -c 'hostname'; done
```



# Task 3 - Scaling a Stateful Set
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scale the Stateful Set to 5 replicas using below.
```
kubectl scale sts nginx-sts --replicas=5
```

## Verify the pods getting created in ordinal way
```
kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx-sts
```
## Verify the PV Claim getting created in ordinal fashion
```
kubectl get pvc -l app=nginx-sts
```
## Edit the stateful Set yam and reduce replicas to 3 
```
kubectl scale sts nginx-sts --replicas=3
```
## Notice that the controller deletes the pods one at a time. It waits for one to completely shut down before going to next
```
kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx-sts
```

## Verify statefulSet’s PersistentVolumeClaims and verify that are not deleted on scaling down. 
```
kubectl get pvc -l app=nginx-sts
```

# Task 4 - Cleanup the resources using below command 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Delete a Stateful Set
```
kubectl delete -f nginx-sts.yaml
```
## List all the PV and PVC’s that has been allocated to Statefulset pods and delete them as below.
```
kubectl get pvc
```
```
kubectl delete pvc --all
```
